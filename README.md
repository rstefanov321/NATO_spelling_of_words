# NATO_spelling_of_words
This program takes a user input (an English word or any string sequence) and outputs the NATO official code words for each letter (e.g. A: Alpha, B: Bravo, etc.)
The idea of the program is to show the power of List and Dictionary Comprehension, which shortens the length of the code without changning its functionality.
